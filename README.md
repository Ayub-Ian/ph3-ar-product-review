# Object Relationships in RUBY
This repository focuses on object relationships and classes, their attributes and behaviours.

This repo contains Many to Many class relationship which is also called the Has-Many-Through relationship, which exists between two objects and occurs when a single instance of an entity, relates to many instance of another entity and vise versa. As an example we have three models: User, Review, and Product.For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.Product - User is a many-to-many relationship.
